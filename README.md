# Credit-card-fraud-detection-model
In this model i have used anomaly detection technique to predict fraud credit card transactions
i have used isolation forest algorithms to isolate anomalies because they are rare and few 
other algorithm which i tried was Local outlier factor and svm but found that isolation performed best
